# picoPET

Optimise your pet to get through the maze the fastest.

As usual, there's never enough time for a project like this. I hope you enjoy what's here; stay tuned for improvements.


_____Gameplay:_____

As you play you can unlock new animals. However, the goal remains the same. Can you configure your pet so
that it takes home the fastest time through the maze? How can good players set themselves apart? Well, pico-pets 
are a little bit robotic, in the sense that they can evolve --> by losing, gaining, or upgrading parts (etc). And critically,
it shouldn't be underestimated the impact a pet's nutrition can have on performance... May the best pet strategy win!


_____Reason:_____

picoPET has been developed for a number of reasons.
- As a dedication game
- To provide novel algorithmic feedback for health research (amazing right)
- As an EDUCATIONAL TOOL for information systems (it's largely geared for this!)
- To assist with micromouse optimisations (a fun and educational competition, check it out)
- And to test Java integreation with the frontend


_____Creation:_____

Games require planning beforehand. Meeting the main requirements/goals means drafting, drawing and prototyping prior to 
ever actually sitting down to program. Wherever possible the game has been left extensible, obviously because modular code is a good thing!
For those interested, the real development experience was identifying and using a Java to JavaScript API to handle rendering of the UI.
Java is a gritty language and therefore doesn't really belong in the frontend, but it's robust nonetheless, so finding workarounds can
pay-off big time where performance is concerned.


_____EDUCATIONAL INSTITUES:_____

If you're using this software in an educational environment you will need to acquire an approved token before acessing your package's
